# Multi‑Bot Chat & Visualization Dashboard

A Dash-based web application that lets you chat with multiple Deepseek LLM-powered “bots” and visualizes their relationships as an interactive network graph.
Each bot maintains its own conversation history, and new bots are added dynamically through conversation with another bot.
The visualization tab shows bots as nodes and “your X is Y” relations as labeled edges.

## Features

- **Chat interface**  
  - Switch between bots in a sidebar  
  - Per‑bot conversation history stored in a `dcc.Store`  
  - Sticky input bar at the bottom  
  - User & assistant messages rendered as chat bubbles

- **Dynamic bot list**  
  - Bot tabs in the sidebar update automatically whenever you add a new bot  
  - Tabbing between “Chat” and “Visualization” panes

- **Interactive network graph**  
  - Uses `dash-cytoscape` to render bots as nodes  
  - Extracts relations from each bot’s system prompt  
  - Edges are labeled and styled (e.g. relation name)  
  - Click a node to see that bot’s last 10 messages  
  - Click an edge to see its relation & metadata

- **Automatic polling**  
  - A hidden `dcc.Interval` callback polls your global `conversation_history` every 2 seconds  
  - Keeps the UI in sync with any external updates to your bot dictionary
