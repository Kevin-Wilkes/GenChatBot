Currently there is only a chat function to chat with the default chatbot named Jhon.
To do this you call:

chat(string user_input ,string bot_name)

if the chatbot creates a reference to a proper noun or uses pronouns it flags the response and will try to generate a new chat bot WITH the context of the response.
I have created a genereric input to reliably generate but haven't perfected the identification of referenced people in the response of the chatbot.

branchable(response) returns true if response contains reference to another person besides the writer

def branch_bot(response, bot_name) generates context for a chatbot that is related to the writer
